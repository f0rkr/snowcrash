# SnowCrash
42 project which aims to introduce us to computer security.

SnowCrash is a **CTF** like project where you have to solve a challenge in order to get a flag to move on to the next level. There is a total of 15 levels (10 regular levels and 5 bonus levels). 

It will test your knowledge in:
- `UNIX` based systems
- Different programming languages such as `ASM, Perl, Lua, PHP`
- Network packet data analysis
- `Shell` scripting

Of course since this is an introduction none of the exercises are too tricky, that being said some of them are a bit more challenging than others.

## Tools

We heavily recommend using the following tools / commands:
- **GDB** *(Please take the time to learn how to use it, seriouly !)*
- **ltrace**
- **Wireshark**
- **curl**
- **netcat**
